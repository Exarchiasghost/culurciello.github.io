Following the [Venture Beat article], that tested a few public image recognition engines on [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) on the [ImageNet categories](http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2014/browse-synsets) only.


Unfortunately ImageNet does not contain a lot of the categories of object we use and see in our everyday life, such as "person", "man", "woman", "hand", etc.

[Teradeep] used a large private dataset of more than 10 Million images to train its image recognition engines.


Here is [Teradeep] image recognition:

Here is how [Metamind] did:

Metamind was only trained on ImageNet, so it does not know what to do with this image.
The hair of Avril look like a broom, the closet object that resembles the image.


Here is how [Clarifai] did - a great job indeed:
